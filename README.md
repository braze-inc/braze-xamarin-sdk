## Components

The format of this repository is that of a Xamarin component: under appboy-component you will find the directories src,
libs, component, and samples. Libs, src, and samples each contain two directories, one for Android and one for iOS. The directories
contain:

- libs: the compiled DLL bindings for the Braze SDKs.
- src: the Xamarin bindings projects that generated the DLLs found in the libs folder.
- samples: Xamarin applications that show how to use the bindings to access the Braze feature set.
- nuget: Nuspec files for our Xamarin Nuget packages.
