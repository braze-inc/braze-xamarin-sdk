## 1.8.0

##### Changed
- Updated the Android binding to use [Braze Android SDK 3.3.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#330).

- Added C# bindings for Braze Android SDK classes with Firebase Cloud Messaging dependencies.

## 1.7.0

##### Breaking
- Updated the Android binding to use [Braze Android SDK 3.2.1](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#321).
  - Added `AppboyFirebaseMessagingService` to directly use the Firebase messaging event `com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT`. This is now the recommended way to integrate Firebase push with Braze. The `AppboyFcmReceiver` should be removed from your `AndroidManifest` and replaced with the following:
    ```
    <service android:name="com.appboy.AppboyFirebaseMessagingService">
    <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
    </intent-filter>
    </service>
    ```
  - Also note that any `c2dm` related permissions should be removed from your manifest as Braze does not require any extra permissions for `AppboyFirebaseMessagingService` to work correctly.
- Updated the native iOS bridge to [Braze iOS SDK 3.14.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.14.0).

## 1.5.2

##### Breaking

##### Fixed
- Fixed an issue that caused C# bindings to not be generated for certain classes in the Braze UI library.

##### Changed
- Updated the Android sample app to use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

## 1.5.1

##### Changed
- Updated the iOS binding to use Braze SDK version [Braze iOS SDK 3.3.4](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.3.4).
  - Added `DisableSDK()` and `RequestEnableSDKOnNextAppRun()` to the `Appboy` interface to disable and re-enable the Braze SDK.
  - Added `WipeDataAndDisableForAppRun()` on the `Appboy` interface to support wiping all customer data created by the Braze SDK.
  - Note that methods that disable the SDK will cause `Appboy.SharedInstance` to return `null`. If you have code that uses `Appboy.SharedInstance`, do not use `DisableSDK()` or `WipeDataAndDisableForAppRun()` until your code can safely execute even if `Appboy.SharedInstance` is null.
- Updated the Android binding to use [Braze SDK version 2.2.5](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#225).
  - Added `DisableSdk()` and `EnableSdk()` to the `Appboy` interface to disable and re-enable the Braze SDK.

## 1.5

##### Breaking

- Updated the Android binding to use [Braze SDK version 2.2.1](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#221).
- Removed the need to include `Appboy.bundle` manually in iOS integrations. Integrators should remove existing `Appboy.bundle` files from their iOS integrations.

##### Added
- Added the ability to report to Braze that the app is running Xamarin to iOS integrations. We strongly recommend reporting this value to allow Braze to calculate accurate usage around different SDK platforms. To enable reporting, add `Appboy.SharedInstance.SdkFlavor = ABKSDKFlavor.Xamarin;` to your `AppDelegate.cs` after calling `Appboy.StartWithApiKey()`.
- Braze Xamarin Bindings are now available on [Nuget](nuget.org). Check out our [iOS Binding](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AppboyPlatformXamariniOSBinding/) and [Android Binding](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AppboyPlatform.AndroidBinding/). Note that Braze Xamarin SDK version `1.5.0` is the last version to receive a Xamarin component store release. Future releases will be released to Nuget and the open source repo only.
